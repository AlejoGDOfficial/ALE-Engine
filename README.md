>[!IMPORTANT]
> ## This engine is still in **Alpha State**
> * Mods created in **Psych Engine** are *(probably)* compatible with this **engine**
> * Multiple editors not working
> * There are very few new features yet
> * The script states don't work as well as Psych hardcoded States
> * The source code is quite deoptimized and has a lot of garbage in it
